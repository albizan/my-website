      "description": "This is my personal website, here I tried exploring and experimenting with some exciting new tools such us TailwindCSS and styled-components. I wanted my portfolio website to be as fast as possible and beautiful in aesthetics, with a clean and sleek user interface. Here, Adam Wathan's TailwindCSS is used to style each component with the utility-first approach and styled-components are used primarily with styled-theming to style each part of this portfolio with a light and a dark theme.",
